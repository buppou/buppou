      "name": "1. The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha Sacca)",
      "description": "The truth about the nature of Suffering. Suffering is not just obvious physical or mental pain, but also the underlying dissatisfaction and unfulfillment in all aspects of cyclic existence. Birth, old age, sickness, death are suffering. Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering. Association with the unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the beloved is suffering. Not getting what one wants is suffering. In short, the five aggregates of clinging are suffering."

      "name": "2. The Truth of the Origin of Suffering (Samudaya Sacca)",
      "description": "The truth about the Cause of Suffering. The deep root of all suffering is Craving (Tanha) - the incessant desire and longing. Craving includes: sensual craving (craving for sense objects), craving for existence (craving to be, to become), and craving for non-existence (craving not to be, self-annihilation). This craving is nourished by Ignorance (Avijja) - the lack of proper understanding of the nature of reality, especially concerning the Four Noble Truths and the law of Karma. From this arise hatred and other defilements."
