    "name": "1. The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha Sacca)",
    "description": "The truth about the nature of Suffering. Suffering is not just obvious physical or mental pain, but also the underlying dissatisfaction and unfulfillment in all aspects of cyclic existence. Birth, old age, sickness, death are suffering. Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering. Association with the unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the beloved is suffering. Not getting what one wants is suffering. In short, the five aggregates of clinging are suffering.",
    "details": "The First Noble Truth, Dukkha Sacca, reveals the pervasive reality of suffering (Dukkha) in existence. Dukkha is a multifaceted term encompassing not only physical and mental pain but also the inherent unsatisfactoriness, stress, and dis-ease that characterize conditioned phenomena. This unsatisfactoriness arises from the impermanent (Anicca) and non-self (Anatta) nature of all things. The Buddha elaborated on Dukkha by identifying various forms of suffering, including the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; association with the unpleasant; separation from the beloved; and not getting what one wants. Fundamentally, the five aggregates of clinging (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) are identified as suffering because they are subject to change and lack a permanent, independent self. Recognizing and comprehending the full scope of Dukkha is the essential first step on the path to liberation."

    "name": "2. The Truth of the Origin of Suffering (Samudaya Sacca)",
    "description": "The truth about the Cause of Suffering. The deep root of all suffering is Craving (Tanha) - the incessant desire and longing. Craving includes: sensual craving (craving for sense objects), craving for existence (craving to be, to become), and craving for non-existence (craving not to be, self-annihilation). This craving is nourished by Ignorance (Avijja) - the lack of proper understanding of the nature of reality, especially concerning the Four Noble Truths and the law of Karma. From this arise hatred and other defilements.",
    "details": "The Second Noble Truth, Samudaya Sacca, identifies the origin or cause of suffering (Dukkha). The primary cause is craving (Tanha), which is a strong desire, longing, or attachment. Tanha manifests in three main forms: kama-tanha (sensual craving for pleasant sensory experiences), bhava-tanha (craving for existence, becoming, or continued rebirth), and vibhava-tanha (craving for non-existence, self-annihilation, or cessation of unpleasant experiences). This relentless craving is rooted in fundamental ignorance (Avijja), which is a lack of deep understanding of the true nature of reality, particularly the Four Noble Truths and the principles of impermanence, suffering, and non-self. Ignorance leads to misconceptions about self and reality, fueling craving and attachment, and perpetuating the cycle of suffering (samsara)."

    "name": "3. The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha Sacca)",
    "description": "The truth about the Cessation of Suffering. This is the state of absolute peace, Nirvana (Nibbana), where all suffering and its causes have been completely eradicated. It is the complete cessation of Craving, Hatred, and Delusion. Nirvana is not a place, but a state of liberated mind, free from all bonds of the cycle of existence.",
    "details": "The Third Noble Truth, Nirodha Sacca, proclaims the possibility of the cessation of suffering (Dukkha). This cessation is the realization of Nirvana (Nibbana), the ultimate goal of the Buddhist path. Nirvana is the complete and irreversible eradication of craving (Tanha), aversion (Dosa), and ignorance (Avijja) â€“ the root causes of suffering. It is a state of profound peace, liberation, and freedom from the cycle of birth, aging, sickness, death, and rebirth (samsara). Nirvana is not a state of annihilation or nothingness, but a transcendental reality that is unconditioned, deathless, and unborn. It is the experience of ultimate reality, beyond the limitations of conditioned existence, and is attained through the full realization of the Four Noble Truths."

    "name": "4. The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering (Magga Sacca)",
    "description": "The truth about the Path of practice leading to the Cessation of Suffering. This is the Noble Eightfold Path (Ariya Atthangika Magga), the middle path consisting of eight components, helping practitioners to cultivate wisdom, liberation, and Nirvana.",
    "details": "The Fourth Noble Truth, Magga Sacca, presents the practical path leading to the cessation of suffering (Dukkha). This path is the Noble Eightfold Path (Ariya Atthangika Magga), which is the middle way, avoiding the extremes of sensual indulgence and severe asceticism. It is the systematic training that cultivates the qualities necessary for liberation and the realization of Nirvana. The Eightfold Path is comprised of eight interconnected factors, often grouped into three divisions: Wisdom (Panna), Ethical Conduct (Sila), and Mental Discipline (Samadhi). Wisdom includes Right View and Right Intention. Ethical Conduct includes Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood. Mental Discipline includes Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. By diligently cultivating these eight factors, practitioners gradually purify their minds, weaken the roots of suffering, and progress towards the ultimate goal of Nirvana."
